# Crashworthiness-optimization-of-NPR-structure-with-Artificial-Intelligence
The problem statement was to optimize the design parameters of the NPR assembly, so that,
The objective functions:
• The energy absorption of the structure is maximum.
• The weight of it is minimum.
And The constraint function:
• The peak reaction force stays under a certain limit.
The variables:
• The variables are theta , t, w in a certain bound
In order to make the simulating environment less complicated the problem setup is simplified as
shown in the figure below.
